# Project Title

Predictive Data Analysis of stock price using Machine Learning. 

## About The Project

It is an application of Sentiment Analysis in Stocks Using Machine Learning Models.
Technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis are three of the most widely used stock research techniques. Perhaps the human factor in these methods of analysis can be eliminated using machine learning. NLP technologies like NLTK's VADER were employed for sentiment analysis in order to ascertain the general public's perception and emotion about a stock. It is hoped that these machine learning models would complement and advance the existing analytical techniques.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.
